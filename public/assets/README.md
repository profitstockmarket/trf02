Assets folder

- Place site images, icons, and other static files here.
- This project uses the Angular/Vite "public" folder, so anything under `public/` is copied to the build output unchanged.
- Files in `public/assets/...` will be served at `/assets/...`.

Examples
- Put a hero image at `public/assets/images/hero.jpg` and reference it as `/assets/images/hero.jpg` in templates or CSS.
- Put an SVG icon at `public/assets/icons/logo.svg` and reference it as `/assets/icons/logo.svg`.

Notes
- Avoid very large images; compress where possible.
- Prefer modern formats (webp/avif) with fallbacks if needed.
- Do not store secrets hereâ€”this folder is publicly served.
